    "# Part 4: Statistical testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this Jupyter notebook, where we will embark on a statistical testing journey to assess the impact of energy efficiency projects in residential homes participating in the Home Performance with ENERGY STAR® Program from 2007 to 2012.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background:**\n",
    "The Home Performance with ENERGY STAR® Program, overseen by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), focuses on promoting energy efficiency. Our analysis involves comparing estimated savings against normalized values from an open-source energy efficiency meter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**About the Home Performance with ENERGY STAR® Program:**\n",
    "\"Home Performance with ENERGY STAR® is a national collaborative program between the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. It includes a network of 32 utility and nonprofit sponsors, along with 1,300 home performance contractors. Since 2001, Home Performance with ENERGY STAR has been the trusted source for contractors and energy programs delivering home energy upgrades. These upgrades make American homes safer, healthier, and more energy-efficient. The program offers a comprehensive evaluation, with recommended work performed by trained and qualified contractors. A cornerstone of the program is a set of rigorous quality assurance requirements.\" (source: [Department of Energy](https://www.energy.gov/eere/buildings/home-performance-energy-starr), retrieved 29.01.2024)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset Overview:**\n",
    "This dataset backcasts estimated modeled savings for completed projects in the State of New York (US) from 2007 to 2012. These projects are part of the Home Performance with ENERGY STAR® Program under Residential Existing Homes (One to Four Units) Predicted First Year Savings for Energy Efficiency Measures: 2007 – 2012. The analysis compares the estimated savings against normalized savings calculated by an open-source energy efficiency meter. Our focus in this notebook is on cleaning and preparing this data to develop, train, and fit machine learning models for accurate predictions.\n",

    "**Datasource:**\n",
    "[Data - New York State](https://data.world/data-ny-gov/jtrr-tvq4) (Retrieved on 29.01.2024)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Project Goal:**\n",
    "Our primary goal is to develop machine learning models capable of predicting gas and energy usage in residential homes as well as the project costs. In a last step we will conduct statistical tests to assess whether there are significant changes in gas usage before and after the energy efficiency projects.\n",
