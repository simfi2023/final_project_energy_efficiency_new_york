Predicting Energy and Gas Savings
====================================================

Welcome to this GitHub repository, where we'll explore the process for a machine learning task aimed at predicting gas and energy use in residential homes that participated in the Home Performance with ENERGY STAR® program from 2007 to 2012.

Background: The Home Performance with ENERGY STAR® Program, overseen by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), emphasizes promoting energy efficiency. The analysis involves comparing estimated savings against normalized values from an open-source energy efficiency meter.

About the Home Performance with ENERGY STAR® Program: "Home Performance with ENERGY STAR® is a national collaborative program between the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that includes a network of 32 utility and nonprofit sponsors, and 1,300 home performance contractors. Since 2001, Home Performance with ENERGY STAR has been the trusted source that helps contractors and energy programs deliver home energy upgrades. These upgrades make American homes safer, healthier, and more energy efficient. The Home Performance with ENERGY STAR program offers a trusted approach to home upgrades that includes a comprehensive evaluation, with recommended work being performed by trained and qualified networks of contractors. A cornerstone of the program is a set of rigorous quality assurance requirements." (source: https://www.energy.gov/eere/buildings/home-performance-energy-starr, retrieved 29.01.2024)

Dataset Overview: This dataset backcasts estimated modeled savings for a subset of completed projects in the State of New York (US) from 2007 to 2012. The projects are part of the Home Performance with ENERGY STAR® Program under Residential Existing Homes (One to Four Units) Predicted First Year Savings for Energy Efficiency Measures: 2007 – 2012. The analysis is against normalized savings calculated by an open-source energy efficiency meter. The primary focus in this notebook is on cleaning and preparing this data to develop, train, and fit machine learning models for accurate predictions.

Project Goal: The primary goal is to develop machine learning models capable of predicting residential gas and energy use after project completion, as well as total project costs. This will involve leveraging insights from the Home Performance with ENERGY STAR® programme dataset and using advanced algorithms to make predictions.
